			<p>
				Camshafts have small lobes on them. The number of lobes a camshaft has
				is directly related to the number of valves and pistons an engine has. 
				As the camshaft is rotated (1/2 the speed of the crankshaft) these lobes push 
				on the valves or linkage connecting to the valves. This force causes the valves
				to open at precisely the correct time. Every engine has at least one camshaft.
				Some have as many as 4 or more depending on configuration.
